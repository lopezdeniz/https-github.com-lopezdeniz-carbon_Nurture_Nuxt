        <p>
  Carbon Nurture has developed environmentally biodegradable plastics to support manufacturing of sustainable materials and regenerative economy. 
  <span class="text-green">CN help mitigating climate change by reducing carbon dioxide</span> emissions due to sequestering carbon in soil and sediments.
</p>
        <p>
          <span class="text-green">Environmentally biodegradable plastics</span> are designed for specific applications with required servicelife characteristics and properties. At their end-of-life they could be recycled biologically, physically, or chemically. Biological recycling is designed to take place at natural environmental conditions and does not require high-temperature composting infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The abiotic degradation is achieved by specially designed advanced redox-promoting catalyst, <span class="text-green">leading to complete conversion of polymers into biodegradable substances</span> with high carbon utilization. Complete conversion prevents formation of persistent micro/nano-plastics.
